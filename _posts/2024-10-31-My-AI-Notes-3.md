## Building AI in your company

Itdoes take maybe two or three years for a company to become good at AI.

Case study: Building a Smart speaker

AI Pipeline to
Processes for command:
1-Trigger word/Wakeword detection :Hey device
2-Speech recognition :Recognize the audio
3-Intent recognition :Tell me a joke/time/music
4-Execute joke


Self-driving cars:
input A:Image/Radar/Lidar/GPS
1. Car detection:supervised learning
2. Pedestrian detection:supervised learning
3. Lane detection
4. Traffic light detection
5. Other obstacles than cars
6. Motion planning:steer/accelerate/brake
7. Trajectory prediction


## Roles of an AI team

- Software engineer
- Machine learning engineer
- Machine learning researcher(extend the state of art of ML)
- Machine learning scientist
- Data scientist (examine data/provide insights/make presentations)
- Data engineer (organize data/make it fast/easily/securely accessable)
- AI product manager

## AI Transformation Playbook

1. Executing pilot projects to gain momentum (6-12 months. can be inhouse/outsource)
2. Build an in-house AI team > to support other seperate Business Units/Lines (matrix hierarchy)
3. AI team under a senior manager of tech/innovation/it etc. CEO to support/funding
4. Broad AI training
    - Executives/Senior	What can AI do >> /AI strategy/Resource allocation
    - Leaders >> Set project direction/reousece allocation/monitor process
    - AI engineer trainees >> Build and ship AI projects/gather data/execute on AI projects			
5. Develope AI strategy (not the step1)
6. Develop internal/external relations
    - Invester relations
    - Government relations
    - Customer/user education
    - Talent/recruiting
    - Internal communications


## AI Strategy

- Leverage AI
- Virtuous Cycle of AI (better product>more data>moroe users>..>better product>...)
- No need to or should try to compete with these large tech companies on AI in general
- Strategic data acquisition
- Unified data warehouse
+ If you are working in a business with these types of winner take all dynamics or winner take most dynamics. Then if AI can be used to help you with growing faster, for example, with accelerating user acquisition. 
+ If your company has a low cost strategy, then perhaps AI can be used to reduce costs for your business. 
+ If your company has a high value strategy to deliver really, really valuable products with a higher cost.



## AI pitfalls to avoid

- Do not expect to solve everything > Be ralistic > consider the limitations > technical/business due diligence
- Do not rely on only ML engineers but pair engineering with business talents

  
## Applications

- Computer Vision
    - Image classification / Object recognition
    - Face recognition
    - Object detection
    - Image segmentation (doesn't just draw rectangles around the objects it detects, instead, it draws very precise boundaries around the objects that)
    - Tracking

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    - Text classification (ie email:spam/not, product description/category, sentiment recognition-text to stars)
    - Information retrieval (web search)
    - Name entitiy recognition
    - Machine translation
- Speech (changing air pressure)
    - Speech recognition (speech-to-text)
    - Trigger word/wakeword detection
    - Speaker ID
    - Speech synthesis (text-to-speech, TTS)

- Generative AI
    - Text generation
    - Image generation
    - Audito generation
- Robotics
    - Perception
    - Motion planning
    - Control
- Genreal Machine Learning
    - Structured data (image, audio, text)
    - Unstructured data
- Unsupervised Learning
    - Clustering
- Transfer Learning
    - Car detection (vehicle) > to > Golf cart detection (sub vehicle category)
- Reinforcement Learning 
    - similar to how you might train a pet dog to behave
    - uses a reward signal, to tell the AI when it's doing well or poorly.
    - games such as Othello or checkers or chess or Go
    - autonomous helicopter/drone
- GANS (Generative Adversarial Network)
- Knowledge Graph

  
## Goldilocks rule for AI

- be not too optimistic or pessimistic

- Limitations
    - Performance
    - Explainibility is hard
    - Biased AI/discrimination/unhealthy stereotypes
    - Adversarial attacks on AI

- Technical solutions of bias
    - "zero out" the bias in the word
    - more inclusive training data
    - transparency and auditing
    - diverse workforce

- Adversarial attacks on AI (AI system is an attempt to make it do something other than what it was intended to do)
    - physical attacks (ie for face recognition)
    - defense do exist, but incur some cost
    - similar to spam/anti-spam, some apps might be developed
    - like a zero-sum game

- Adverse uses of AI
    - Deep fake
    - Fake comments
    - Spam/anti-spam, fraud/anti-fraud
 
## Social Impacts

- Min 400m jobs is forecasted to be displaced by AI by 2030.
    - Office support
    - Production work
    - Food servcies
    - Mechanical installation and repair
    - Community services
    - Agriculture
    - Business and legal proffesionals	
	Customer service and sales
	Educators
	Creatives and arts management
