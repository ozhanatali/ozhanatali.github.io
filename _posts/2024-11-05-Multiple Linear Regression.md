# Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

A model with two or more explanatory variables is a multiple linear regression.
This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, which predicts multiple correlated dependent variables rather than a single dependent variable.

$$ \mathit f_{w,b}(x) = w_{1} x_{1} + w_{2} x_{2} + ... +  w_{n} x_{n} + \beta_{0} $$
