Starting an AI project
===================
-Workflow of projects
-Selecting AI projects
-Organizing data and team for the projects


Workflow of a ML Project
===================
ie speech recognition or self-driving car
tools:Amazon Echo/Alexa keywords

Step1:	Collect data
Step2:	Train model (You have to iterate many times until, hopefully, the model looks like is good enough.)
Step3:	Deploy model (incl. maitain/update)



Workflow of a Data Science Project
===================
ie Optimize a sales funnel (of an onlines market)
or automize a manufacturing line
or ML to prioritize the leads of customers/collections
or Automated visual inspections
or Automated resume screening
or Recommending personalized ads/services

Step1:	Collect data
Step2:	Analyze data
Step3:	Suggest hypotheses/actions


**Every job function needs to learn how to use data


How to choose an AI Project
===================


Interception of "what AI can do/AI experts" and "Valuable for your business/domain experts"

Brainstorming framework:
========================
...much more useful to think about automating tasks rather than automating jobs...
...you can make progress even without big data, even without tons of data...

1st due diligence (technical/business/ethical) the project before starting
1-Technical:
-Consider AI performance
-How much data needed
-Engineering timeline
2-Busines:
-Costs
-Revenue
-Launch new product/business?
3-Ethical diligence


Build or Buy??
========================
ML can be 		>inhouse/outsource
Data Science 		>inhouse
if an industry standard >avoid building it


Working with an AI team
========================

-specify an acceptance criteria for the project

# of Training set > # of Stest Set


Technical tools for AI teams
========================
Open Source: 	PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face PaddlePaddle, Scikit-Learn, or R
Academic:	Arxiv
Open Repo:	GitHub
edge deployments:the computation has to happen usually in a computer right there inside the car, that's called an edge deployment.
