| Gaussian   Mixture Model (GMM)                                                       | Distribution-based   (Probabilistic)                                                               | Uses multiple Gaussian   distributions to fit arbitrarily shaped data. The model calculates the   probability that a data point belongs to a specific Gaussian distribution and   that's the cluster it will fall under.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |     - Can model clusters of different shapes and sizes, assuming a   Gaussian distribution for each cluster.<br>       - Provides probabilistic cluster   membership, allowing soft assignments. |     - Sensitive to the initial parameters and can converge to local   optima.<br>       - Computationally intensive for   high-dimensional data.                                        |     - Financial modeling and anomaly detection, tasks with overlapping or   ellipsoidal clusters.                                          |
| BIRCH -   The Balance Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies            | Hierarchical-based (although it   combines elements of centroid-based and hierarchical approaches) | Works better on large data sets   than the k-means algorithm. It breaks the data into little summaries that are   clustered instead of the original data points. The summaries hold as much   distribution information about the data points as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |     - Scalable to large datasets; efficient in terms of memory   usage.<br>       - Can be used to initialize other   clustering methods.                                                        |     - Performs poorly with non-spherical clusters.<br>       - May merge clusters prematurely if   thresholds are not chosen carefully.                                                 |     - Large datasets requiring efficient clustering, such as retail   customer data and sales analysis.                                    |
| Affinity   Propagation                                                               | Uses a message-passing approach   that can be loosely categorized as graph-based                   | This clustering algorithm is   completely different from the others in the way that it clusters data. Each   data point communicates with all of the other data points to let each other   know how similar they are and that starts to reveal the clusters in the data.   You don't have to tell this algorithm how many clusters to expect in the   initialization parameters.<br>     As messages are sent between data points, sets of data called exemplars are   found and they represent the clusters.<br>     An exemplar is found after the data points have passed messages to each   other and form a consensus on what data point best represents a   cluster.<br>      |     - Automatically determines the number of clusters based on the   data.<br>       - Works well for non-spherical   clusters and does not require initial centroids.                           |     - Memory and computation-intensive for large datasets.<br>       - Sensitive to parameter choices,   especially the preference parameter.                                           |     - Situations where the number of clusters is unknown, such as image   processing or document clustering.                               |
| Mean-Shift   (also referred to as the mode-seeking algorithm)                        | Centroid-based                                                                                     | Similar to the BIRCH algorithm   because it also finds clusters without an initial number of clusters being   set. This is a hierarchical clustering algorithm. It works by iterating over   all of the data points and shifts them towards the mode. The mode in this   context is the high density area of data points in a region. It will go   through this iterative process with each data point and move them closer to   where other data points are until all data points have been assigned to a   cluster.<br>                                                                                                                                                           |     - Does not require specifying the number of clusters; adaptable to   arbitrary-shaped clusters.<br>       - Effective for image processing   and segmentation.                               |     - Computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.<br>       - Performance is sensitive to the   selection of the bandwidth parameter.                                     |     - Image segmentation, object tracking, and tasks involving density   estimation.                                                       |
| OPTICS -   Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure                      | Density-based                                                                                      | Only   processes each data point once, similar to DBSCAN. There's also a special   distance stored for each data point that indicates a point belongs to a   specific cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     - Similar to DBSCAN but can handle clusters with varying   densities.<br>       - Generates a reachability plot,   which can be used to determine cluster structures.                        |     - More computationally intensive than DBSCAN.<br>       - Requires parameter tuning for   optimal performance.                                                                      |     - Clustering tasks where density varies, such as geospatial data,   customer segmentation with complex density structures.             |

It's used to group objects in clusters based on how   similar they are to each other. This is a form of bottom-up clustering, where   each data point is assigned to its own cluster. Then those clusters get   joined together. At each iteration, similar clusters are merged until all of   the data points are part of one big root cluster.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Provides a dendrogram, offering   insights into hierarchical relationships between clusters. Does not require   specifying the number of clusters in advance.                                    | Computationally expensive for   large datasets.Sensitive to the choice of distance metric.                                                                                              | Small to medium-sized datasets.
